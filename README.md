## Requirements

- Xcode 15+
- iOS 16+
- Swift Package Manager
- A [Seam workspace](https://docs.seam.co) and API key

---

## Installation

Add **Seam Mobile Components** to your project using **Swift Package Manager**:

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/seamapi/SeamComponents", from: "1.0.0")
]
```

Then import it:

```swift
import SeamComponents
```

---

## Quick Start

The fastest way to get started is with `SeamAccessView`, which orchestrates all underlying components to deliver a complete unlock experience:

```swift
import SwiftUI
import SeamComponents

struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        SeamAccessView()
    }
}
```

Thatâ€™s it â€” you now have a fully functional unlock UI in your app.

---

## How It Works with Seam Mobile SDK

`SeamAccessView` automatically hooks into the SDK for device discovery, credential management, and unlock flows.

---

## Theming

Seam Mobile Components are fully brandable using `SeamTheme`. Apply your own colors, fonts, and styles globally or locally:

```swift
let customTheme = SeamTheme(
  colors: .default.with(accent: .orange),
  fonts: .default.with(largeTitle: .system(size: 36, weight: .bold)),
  keyCard: .default.with(cornerRadius: 20)
)

SeamAccessView()
  .environment(\.seamTheme, customTheme)
```
